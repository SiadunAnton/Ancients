# Game project "Ancients"

This is a pet-project, where i study to work with basic mechanics in unity game engine. Also, an idea for gameplay was created by myself.

## Used technologies
For AI, i choosed a **NodeCanvas** package. Its is simple and allow to create fantastic and comlicated behaviours trees.

## The Goals i have in mind
- Realization of the game must not change the final affect from gameplay.
- Domain model must be opened for changing and allow to add new object fast as its can.
- AI shows a competitive behaviour for testing skills of main character of any type(area skills,buff and other).
